// Declares a public class named 'car_If_else'.

// Declaring class attributes (properties of the car)
// A private string variable 'brand', set to "BMW".
// A private static integer 'wheels', set to 4. Static means it's shared among all instances of the class.
// A private float 'engineCapacity', set to 4.6.
// A private double 'fuelCapacity', set to 2.66.
// A private integer 'speed', initially set to 0.
// A private variable 'currentGear' of type Gear (an enum defined below).
// A private boolean 'engineOn', initially set to false indicating the engine is off.

// Enum for gear states
// An enumeration representing gear states.

// Constructor of the class
// Sets the default gear to PARK when an object of the class is created.

// Method to start the engine of the car
// Checks if the engine is off
// Starts the engine
// Prints to the console
// Prints if the engine is already on

// Method to stop the engine of the car
// Checks if the engine is on
// Stops the engine
// Resets speed to 0
// Sets gear to PARK
// Prints to the console
// Prints if the engine is already off

// Method to change gears of the car
// Checks if the engine is on
// Changes the current gear to the specified gear
// Prints the new gear
// Prints if the engine is off

// Method to accelerate the car
// Checks if the engine is on and the gear is in DRIVE
// Increases the speed
// Prints the current speed
// Prints if unable to accelerate

// Method to apply brakes to the car
// Checks if the car is moving
// Reduces the speed, ensuring it doesn't go below 0
// Prints the current speed
// Prints if the car is already stopped

// The main method - the entry point of the program
// Creates an instance of 'car_If_else'
// Calls the startEngine method
// Changes the gear to DRIVE
// Accelerates the car by 20 km/h
// Applies brakes to reduce speed by 10 km/h
// Stops the engine
